    Here is the ReadMe file for my Spaced Repitition Software Website.  For this assignment we were tasked to create an interactive website that provides information about Onslow College’s history, whenua, local iwi, and te reo Māori terms. Further, students will be able to take Spaced Repetition tests to determine their understanding of the information.

Onslow SRS is the project I have been working on covering these three NZCEA Level 3 standards. 


#### Brief

In 2021, based on consultation with students, staff members, whānau, and the local community, Onslow College adopted a new set of school values.

One of the new values is whakapapa: “this value is about the layers that make up who we are”. This means we acknowledge and celebrate the diverse upbringings, cultures, and backgrounds that each student and staff member brings to the school.
As part of that, it is also important to knowledge the history of the school itself, its surrounding whenua (area), the peoples who contribute to it, and what Onslow College contributes back to the community.

A specific opportunity has been identified to educate students about the history of Onslow College, the local area, the iwi that make up the area, and relevant terms in te reo Māori that help explain Onslow College’s whakapapa and the surrounding whenua.
